This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which will fail to compile due to Rust's borrow checker. The `bugSolution.rs` file offers a solution showing how to refactor the code to avoid this error. This typically involves using techniques like cloning, passing values instead of references, or restructuring the code to eliminate the need for multiple mutable borrows.
